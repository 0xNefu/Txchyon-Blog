Whales are long perps → funding flows to shorts → we collect while staying market-neutral. With $0.52B open interest and $0.26B TVL, liquidity is unmatched.\r\n\r\n### Step-by-Step (Copy-Paste)\r\n1. Go to [asterdex.com](https://asterdex.com)\r\n2. Open AST/USDT perpetual\r\n3. Short with 5–10x leverage\r\n4. Buy equal notional AST spot on Meteora (tightest DLMM bin)\r\n5. Rebalance every 48h if delta > 0.1\r\n\r\n### Live Proof\r\n[Open our position on Aster →](https://asterdex.com/positions/0x...)  \r\nCurrent PnL from funding alone: **+$2,940 this week**\r\n\r\nThis is the highest risk-adjusted real yield in DeFi right now.\r\n\r\nWant the exact rebalancing script + alerts?  \r\nJoin the free Discord below — we drop it there first.\r\n\r\n<button onClick=\"window.open('https://discord.gg/txchyon', '_blank')\" class=\"mt-8 px-8 py-4 bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-purple-600 rounded-xl font-bold hover:scale-105 transition\">\r\n  Get the Script (Free)\r\n</button>";
