Every major AI agent project launching in Q4 2025–Q1 2026 is quietly migrating to iopn infra.\r\n2. Revenue accrual model: 30% of all agent fees go straight to $IOPN stakers.\r\n3. Current FDV: ~$312M — still sub-$500M while doing $1.2M monthly revenue.\r\n4. Supply locked: 78% of circulating supply staked.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been buying the dip every day since $0.28 and will continue until mainnet v2 ships (expected Jan 2026).\r\n\r\nPosition: Long $IOPN spot + running 3 validator nodes.\r\n\r\nThe AI agent meta hasn’t even started. iopn is the pick-and-shovel play.\r\n\r\n[Track iopn live →](https://iopn.network)";
